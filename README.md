## Overview

This project is an interpreter and REPL for a simple, expression-oriented, strongly-typed programming language called **MiniLang**, implemented in **Python**. It is designed to help understand the fundamental concepts of compiler theory, such as lexical analysis (lexer), syntax parsing (parser), and evaluation, all while creating a small, functional interpreter. 

The project was developed as part of a programming assignment for a **Compiler Theory and Practice** course, aimed at providing practical exposure to compiler design.

## Features

- **MiniLang Interpreter** with a command-line REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop)
- Supports basic arithmetic operations, string manipulation, recursion, variable assignments, and function calls.
- Language supports **C-style comments** and has a strongly-typed system with `int`, `real`, `bool`, and `string` data types.
- Provides **automatic typecasting** between `int` and `real` types (except for function parameters).
- **Function overloading** is allowed based on different parameter signatures.

## The MiniLang Language

MiniLang is a strongly-typed language that supports the following features:

### Data Types:
- **int**: Integer values.
- **real**: Floating-point numbers.
- **bool**: Boolean values.
- **string**: String literals.

**###To run and test the interpreter, follow these steps:**
-git clone https://github.com/Mishra-0709/Minilang-Py-Compiler.git
cd Minilang-Py-Compiler
-Install any necessary dependencies (if any). This interpreter doesn't require complex installations, just ensure Python 3.x is available.
-python main.py
-MiniLang Interpreter
Type 'exit' to quit.
